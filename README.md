Tool for flash tokens generation on Ethereum network

Tool is a standalone Windows application developed for educational purposes to streamline the process of sending flash token transactions (USDT, USDC, DAI) on the Ethereum blockchain. Built using Python, with tkinter for the graphical user interface and web3.py for blockchain interaction, the tool is compiled into a portable .exe file, eliminating the need for a Python environment or additional dependencies.

Key Features

Portable Executable: No installation or Python setup requiredâ€”download and run the .exe directly.
Intuitive User Interface: A clean and straightforward GUI for entering wallet private keys, recipient addresses, and transaction details.

Supported Tokens: Facilitates sending USDT, USDC, and DAI with automatic decimal precision handling.

Transaction Management: Enables sending transactions and canceling pending ones by overriding with a higher gas price.

Real-Time Feedback: Displays wallet address, ETH balance, and transaction status updates.

Infura Integration: Connects to the Ethereum mainnet via a customizable Infura API key.

Safety Mechanisms: Validates Ethereum addresses and provides warnings for insufficient gas funds.
